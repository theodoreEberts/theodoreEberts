- 👋 Hi, I’m @theodoreEberts
- 👀 I’m interested in Deep learning with a focus on model interpretibility and robustness.  Bikes, skiing, dogs as well.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build a network that confounds another classifier.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new interesting deep learning packages, models, ideas.  Specifically, I would love to learn more about deep learning in medicine or music.
